                    This is a list of Haram Nasheeds mentioned in Post of 00 April 2023, Nasheeds that You are listening are Haram but You don't know about it, I have included
                    both the instrumental track and vocals track to convince you that the following Nasheed is actually haram due to the
                    presence of musical instruments in it.

                <h4>1. Kun Anta</h4>
                <p>Yes, one of the most popular and favorite Nasheeds of our Ummah is actually Haram. This Nasheed is all over our Instagram reels, Tiktok, YouTube Shorts & literally everywhere. But sadly our ummah does not know that 99% of versions of Kun Anta are haram there is only 1 or 2 Halal versions available on the internet that are hard to find so because one of the other versions has some form of musical instruments in the background or the Nasheed itself is Lofi that makes the Nasheed Haram so I deiced to make a halal version myself which is mentioned below. The Halal version has no musical instruments, it's not the lofi version, and most importantly, the Halal versions are Sound Engineered by Me 2-3 times to ensure that all of the haram elements of the Nasheed is removed. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>
            We focus on creating content that is beneficial for the ummah watching our content because today
            most of the islamic pages are uploading usless uislamic content which is basically entertainment
            in the name of islam. The social media feed of most of our ummah is filed with such useless or
            unauthentic content and haram nasheeds in the background of such content. this is damaging our
            ummah so we decided to change it.
            </p>

            <p>
            I am not a scholar but i have minimum amount of required knowledge for making such content
            and commitment i focus more on the scholarly opinion rather than my own interpretations. So
            it's completely fine if you wish to follow my content as i try my level best to make the most
            authentic content for our ummah and i am only doing this for gaining good deeds in my account
            and not for showing off. Peace be upon You.
